Build dependencies on Fedora:
yum install bison flex swig flex-static flex-devel pcre-devel bzip2-devel ustr-devel audit-libs-devel libcap-ng-devel

To build and install everything under a private directory, run:
make DESTDIR=~/obj install install-pywrap

To install as the default system libraries and binaries
(overwriting any previously installed ones - dangerous!),
on x86_64, run:
make LIBDIR=/usr/lib64 SHLIBDIR=/lib64 install install-pywrap relabel
or on x86 (32-bit), run:
make install install-pywrap relabel

This may render your system unusable if the upstream SELinux userspace
lacks library functions or other dependencies relied upon by your
distribution.  If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.
